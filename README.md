# TimeDateWeather

Super basic date + time + weather (and day's forecast) + steps + hr. No fuss.
[Open weather map api](https://openweathermap.org/api).

![screencap](screencap.png)

Today's forecast is in orange- will be either "Rain", "Snow", "Clouds", or
"Clear", summarizing the day's forecast.

*Note: if weather data doesn't update after installing, go to the clockface's
settings and select either "Celsius" or "Fahrenheit", which will force a weather
refresh*
